  <em>Chrome Hearts is a high-end luxury brand founded in 1988 in Los Angeles, known for its bold, edgy designs that blend gothic, punk, and rock aesthetics. Originally focused on silver jewelry, the brand has since expanded into clothing, eyewear, furniture, and home goods — all handcrafted with meticulous attention to detail. Chrome Hearts has built a strong cult following thanks to its exclusive releases, limited availability, and collaborations with artists and celebrities. It's often associated with underground fashion and has become a symbol of rebellious, high-end streetwear culture.
