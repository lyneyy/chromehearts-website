        <h10> History </h10>
        <a> Richard Stark and John Bowman started the business in a Los Angeles garage in early 1988. Bowman was a manufacturer of leather goods, while Stark merchandised top grade raw leathers. They initially established the label in order to produce leather jackets that weren't available on the market. The third partner was master sterling silver jeweller Leonard Kamhout. The company's first task was a costume design for Chopper Chicks in Zombietown, co-starring the girlfriend of Steve Jones,the lead guitarist of the Sex Pistols; Stark took the name of the brand from the working title of the movie.In 1992, the brand was awarded Accessory Designer Award of the Year by the CFDA. In 1994, Stark, Bowman, and Kamhout had a falling-out, and Bowman and Kamhout withdrew from the brand. Since 1994, Chrome Hearts has been co-owned by Richard Stark and his wife Laurie Lynn Stark.

<br> <br> In 1996, the first Chrome Hearts boutique opened at 159 East, 64th Street, Manhattan, New York City.In 1999, a second boutique opened in Minami-Aoyama, Tokyo. In 2000, Richard Stark collaborated with Tommy Perse, owner of Maxfield, and architect Mark Steele to build a third boutique in West Hollywood, Los Angeles. In 2003, Chrome Hearts opened a boutique at Prince's Building, Hong Kong. <br> <br>

In the early 2000s, Chrome Hearts began publishing its own fashion magazine, which featured interviews and celebrity photoshoots, many of which were shot by Laurie Lynn Stark. It was published until 2017. In April 2020, Chrome Hearts sued clothing brand MNML for using their trademark cross symbol on jeans.

Chrome Hearts is primarily recognized for its clothing, accessories, furniture, leather products, and eyewear. Majority of their products are produced in their Hollywood production factory.

In 2016, they introduced their first fragrance collection, based on two scents, featuring products such as incense and Eau de Parfum. 

<br> <br>
In the early 1990s, Chrome Hearts began to diversify its product range, including fine jewelry, eyewear, furniture, and clothing. Their distinctive gothic, rock 'n' roll-inspired aesthetic, characterized by the use of materials such as leather, sterling silver, and exotic woods, set them apart in the luxury market. Notably, the brand's cross motifs, fleur-de-lis, and dagger designs became iconic.

Chrome Hearts' reputation for exceptional craftsmanship and exclusivity was further cemented by its commitment to handmade products. Every piece was meticulously crafted in their Los Angeles factory, ensuring a high standard of quality. This commitment to artisanship contributed to the brand's allure and high price point.
